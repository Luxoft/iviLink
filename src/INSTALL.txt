           on another Linux OS, but some or all items of this instruction maybe inactual there. Luxoft doesn't test the
           build procedure on operating systems other than Ubuntu of versions mentioned above.
	b) GCC version <NN> shall be installed. Ensure you have compiler prepared with using the following command:
	   sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make .
        c) Qt framework shall be installed. You may install Qt with using the following command:

           Ensure there're no build errors in the log.
	d) Run the following command to deploy built SDK on the local system:
		make install


III. Run SDK and demo applications
	
	Pay attention: you should have two computers connected to the same IP network with no NAT to run this technology
        preview sample apps. The following actions must be performed on both of PCs.
	a) Enter src_install directory
	b) run "IVILinkSystemController -g client" on one of the PCs and "IVILinkSystemController -g server" on another
