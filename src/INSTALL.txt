1.2. System requirements
	
	Target OS for iviLink SDK Version 1.0 is Ubuntu x86 (ver 10.10 or higher). Source code was developed and tested in this environment.


1.3. Required packages

		sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make
        
	b) Qt framework. Enter following command in Ubuntu Terminal to add this package:
		sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake


1.4. Building and deploying iviLink SDK

	a) Go to “src” folder

	b) Run following command to build SDK components:
		make
	Make sure no build errors occurred

	c)  Run following command to deploy SDK:
		make install

	Libraries and executable files have to be copied to “src_install” folder.

2. Executing demo applications
	
	Applications delivered together with iviLink SDK intended for demo purposes only. To use them you need 2 instances of SDK running on different Ubuntu installations. 
	- One way is to install 2 SDKs on independent PCs both running Ubuntu OS
	- Other option is to install Virtual Machine application on main Ubuntu instance. Inside this Virtual Machine run second Ubuntu.

	One instance represents Head Unit. Such applications contain "HU" suffix in its name. Another instance represents mobile phone/tablet. These applications contain "Client" in its name. Example:
	ClimateHU_App - climate application for Head Unit side
	ClimateClient_App - climate application for Mobile Device side

	Before executing demo applications make sure both iviLink instances are connected to the same IP network. This network should not have NAT. Not more than two iviLink instances should run in one IP network.

	To execute demo application please follow these steps:
		
	a) Enter “src_install” directory on both sides

	b) Run “IVILinkSystemController” on both sides. System Controller and Connectivity Agent are two essential components to establish link between devices. When connection is running, applications may be executed.
		
	c) Authentication application will start automatically. User has to enter 4-digit pin-code. Same pin-code should be repeated on other side to confirm security identity.
		
	d) Finally run ClimateHU_App or SeatHU_App on one of the Ubuntu instances. Notice that you’re running application which represents Head Unit side. Corresponding Mobile Device application will be started automatically on other side. 


2. Deinstallation

	If you want to uninstall iviLink please run following command from the “src” folder:
		make clean

	Manually remove “iviLink” folder to complete the process. This way you will eliminate all files installed on your PC with iviLink.
