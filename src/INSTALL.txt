1. Software installation

1.1 Distribution

    iviLink is distributed as source codes via github private repository 
    (https://github.com/Luxoft/iviLink)

    Source codes may downloaded directly from teh github web-site as zip or 
    tar.qz archive (https://github.com/Luxoft/iviLink/downloads).
    As a second option sources may be obtained by clonning the ivilink 
    repository from the github.


1.2 System requirements
	
    Version 1.1 of the iviLink SDK is intended to be build and used under 
    Ubuntu OS x86, version 10.10 or higher. Ubuntu 11.10 x86, Android versions 
    4.0.4, 3.0.1 and 2.2 were used as development and testing platforms for 
    iviLink version 1.1.


1.3 Installation order

1.3.1 Prerequisites

1.3.1.1 Ubuntu

    a) gcc version 4.6.1 should be installed. The following command may be used 
    in order to install the required development tools:
	sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make
        
    b) Qt framework is required for iviLink SDK. It may be installed with the 
    following command:
	sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake

    c) Protobuf should be installed. If you are going to install Android version
    of iviLink too, you don't need to install protobuf on this step.
	sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev

1.3.1.2 Android + Ubuntu

    a) If you have protobuf installed, it is better to remove it first. 
    It will be installed at step b.

    b) You will need ant, JDK and JRE: run 
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk ant 
    and add the following line to ~/.bashrc: 
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386:
    Then you should check (or set, if needed) the java path with command
	sudo update-alternatives --config java
    Correct path is /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java.

    c) download and install (unzip) Android SDK and Android NDK (download links 
    to the newest versions can be found here: 
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and here: 
	http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html). 
    After unzipping you have only core SDK tools, so you need to navigate to the
    tools/ directory in the Android SDK location and execute "android" - Android
    SDK Manager.
    Here you need: 
	- Android SDK Tools;
	- Android SDK Platform-Tools;
	- Android Platform 4.1 (API 16).

    If you have any problems, the full Android SDK installation guide is here: 
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html.

    d) add paths to the SDK and NDK to your PATH variable. Edit the ~/.bashrc 
    file: add the following line 
	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android-ndk:/path/to/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools:/path/to/android-sdk-linux/tools:
    (replace "/path/to/..." segments with your actual paths)


1.3.2 Building and deploying the iviLink SDK

1.3.2.1 Ubuntu

    a) Enter the iviLink/src folder and run
	make
    Make sure there are no build errors occurred.

    b) Run the following command to deploy the SDK to the local system:
	make install

    After the deployment library and executable files to be copied to the 
    src_install folder.

1.3.2.2 Android + Ubuntu

    a) Enter the iviLink/src folder

    b) Check your Internet connection (it is necessary), then run 
	ant setup -Dndk.dir=/path/to/android-ndk
    (replace the "/path/to/.." part with your actual path). This command will 
    create local.properties for iviLink and sample projects, it will download
    and prepare protobuf (needed for samples). You will prompted to enter your 
    sudo password, it is necessary to install protobuf.

    c) Run
	ant build 
    it will build iviLink stack and applications for Ubuntu and for Android.
    You can find it in iviLink/src_install and iviLink/src_install/android.
    You can use the command 
        ant build-android 
    but it will fail if Ubuntu version ("ant build-ubuntu" or "ant build") has 
    not been build before
    
    d) if you have an Android device connected to your PC, you can run 
	ant install-android
    to get the SDK and samples installed on it.
   

1.4 Executing the demo applications
	
    The applications available with the iviLink SDK are for demonstration 
    purposes only. iviLink SDK is intended to be used as a communication 
    technology between in-car Headunit and Android or iOS based mobile 
    phone/tablet. Release 1.1 supports only Ubuntu and Android platforms, 
    however there should be two parties with the SDK installed in order to use 
    the demonstration application. One of the devices (PC or mobile device) is 
    playing a role of the in-car Headunit, the second device is substituting 
    mobile phone/tablet. 

    Before demo applications execution make sure two devices have iviLink SDK 
    installed, moreover both devices are connected to the same IP network with 
    no NAT and the communication over the IP network between the PCs may be 
    established. There should be not more than 2 devices with iviLink SDK 
    running connected to the same IP network.

    To execute the demo application please follow the steps below:
		
	a) Enter src_install directory on both devices

	b) Run IVILinkSystemController (for Android - iviLink) on both devices -
	System controller to be executed on each of the PCs/tablets/mobile 
	phones. System controller executes the Connectivity agent which connects 
	to the Connectivity agent on the other party. After connection is 
	established sample application may be executed.
		
	c) First of all Authentication application to be started automatically. 
	It requires 4-digit pin-code. Exactly the same pin-code must be 
	entered on both sides in order to proceed.
		
	d) Run Seat_App on one of devices. Appropriate application to be started
	automatically on the other side. 


1.5 Deinstallation

1.5.1 Ubuntu

    In case it is required to clean up the installation please run
	make clean
    from the src folder.

1.5.2 Android

    In case it is required to clean up the Android installation please run
	ant clean-android
    from the src folder.


For all platforms:

    For complete source code files removal please remove the iviLink folder. 
    In this case all teh build libraries and executable files to be removed as 
    well.
