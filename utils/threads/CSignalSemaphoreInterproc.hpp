/**
 * WARNING: Please, think twice before use this class.
 * The state of posix named semaphore is persistent between launches
 * in case if no one called unlink - it can be when application caught a signal 
 * and crashed. So semaphore can be left in closed or opened state. And next
 * launch of application will use it without recereating. 
 * This is fundamental flaw of posix named semaphores. SysV semaphores are better 
 * in this, but they are not supported on android etc.
 * Probably, this can be fixed using some other means like lock-files 
 * (syncronisation of semaphore creation - pretty stupid).
