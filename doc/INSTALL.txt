1.3 Installation order

1.3.1 Prerequisites

1.3.1.1 Ubuntu only
   

    0) The easiest way is to run the setup_env.sh script (press "n" and "Enter" when prompted 
    about installing the Android environment). Follow these instructions if you prefer to do the setting up manually.

    a) gcc version 4.6.1 should be installed. The following command may be used 
    in order to install the required development tools:
	sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make automake
        
    b) Qt framework is required for iviLink SDK. It may be installed with the 
    following command:
	sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake

    c) Phonon development package should be installed. The following command may be used for the installation: 
        sudo apt-get install phonon-backend-gstreamer libphonon4 phonon libphonon-dev

    d) vlc should be installed: 
        sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-53 libvlc-dev vlc

    e) mailutils and sharutils should be installed:
        sudo apt-get install mailutils sharutils
    
    f) utils for using bluetooth:
        sudo apt-get install libbluetooth3 libbluetooth-dev

1.3.1.2 Android + Ubuntu
    0) The easiest way is to run the setup_env.sh script (press "Enter" when prompted 
    about installing the Android environment). Follow these instructions if you prefer to do the setting up manually.

    a) Add some additional sources for downloading packages. 
    Go to System Settings -> Software Sources -> Other Software and select
    Canonical partners and Canonical Partners (Source Code).
    After that make the following command:
        sudo apt-get update

    b) You will need ant, JDK and JRE: run 
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk ant 
    and add the following line to ~/.bashrc: 
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386:
    Then you should check (or set, if needed) the java path with command
	sudo update-alternatives --config java
    Correct path is /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java.

    c) download and install (unzip) Android SDK and Android NDK (download links 
    to the newest versions can be found here: 
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and here: 
	http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html). 
    After unzipping you have only core SDK tools, so you need to navigate to the
    tools/ directory in the Android SDK location and execute "android" - Android
    SDK Manager.
    Here you need: 
	- Android SDK Tools;
	- Android SDK Platform-Tools;
	- Android Platform 4.1 (API 16).
    - Google APIs for Android API 16

    If you have any problems, the full Android SDK installation guide is here: 
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html.

    d) add paths to the SDK and NDK to your PATH variable. Edit the ~/.bashrc 
    file: add the following lines 
	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android-ndk:/path/to/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools:/path/to/android-sdk-linux/tools:
	export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk-linux/
    (replace "/path/to/..." segments with your actual paths). Don't forget to restart the terminal prior to building.


1.3.2 Building and deploying the iviLink SDK

1.3.2.1 Ubuntu

    a) Enter the root iviLink folder and run
	make
    Make sure there are no build errors occurred.

    b) Run the following command to deploy the SDK to the local system:
	make install

    After the deployment libraris, core-stack and  applications executable files will be copied to the iviLink/iviLink/lib,
    iviLink/iviLink/bin and iviLink/iviLink/applications folders respectively.

1.3.2.2 Android + Ubuntu
        
    a) Enter the root iviLink folder

    b) Run
	ant build 
    it will build iviLink stack and applications for Ubuntu and for Android.
    You can find it in iviLink/bin, iviLink/lib, iviLink/applications  and iviLink/android_apk.
    You can use the command 
        ant build-android (to build Android apps only)
        ant build-ubuntu (to build Ubuntu apps only)
    
    c) if you have an Android device connected to your PC, you can run 
	ant install-android
    to get the SDK and samples installed on it.

    d) for more detailed info please run "ant" or "ant help" in the iviLink folder, 
    it will print help on different commands you can use.
   

1.4 Executing the demo applications
	
    The applications available with the iviLink SDK are for demonstration 
    purposes only. iviLink SDK is intended to be used as a communication 
    technology between in-car Headunit and Android or iOS based mobile 
    phone/tablet. Release 1.2.0 supports only Ubuntu and Android platforms, 
    however there should be two parties with the SDK installed in order to use 
    the demonstration application. One of the devices (PC or mobile device) is 
    playing a role of the in-car Headunit, the second device is substituting 
    mobile phone/tablet. 

    Before demo applications execution make sure two devices have iviLink SDK 
    installed, moreover both devices are connected to the same IP network with 
    no NAT and the communication over the IP network between the PCs may be 
    established. There should be not more than 2 devices with iviLink SDK 
    running connected to the same IP network.

    To execute the demo application please follow the steps below:
		
	a) Enter iviLink/bin directory on both devices

	b) Run IVILinkSystemController (for Android - the iviLink application) on both devices -
	System controller to be executed on each of the PCs/tablets/mobile 
	phones. System controller executes the Connectivity agent which connects 
	to the Connectivity agent on the other party. After connection is 
	established sample application may be executed.
		
	c) First of all Authentication application to be started automatically. 
	It requires 4-digit pin-code. Exactly the same pin-code must be 
	entered on both sides in order to proceed.
		
	d) Run Seat_App on one of devices. Appropriate application to be started
	automatically on the other side.
