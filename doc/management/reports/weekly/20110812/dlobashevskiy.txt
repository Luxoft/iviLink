weekly report

8 Aug 2011 - 12 Aug 2011

What was done this week
Test RPC compiler.
Investigate possibility of using fuse-based filesystems for masquerade AXIS sockets under Berkeley interface.
Results are negative - FUSE file system is attractive but unfortunately Linux-specific.
We can use FUSE only on Linux boxes with loaded appropriate kernel module.
Start write specification of axis.queue
Start write interface for high level PAD interaction

Open issues:
test matrix:
test type		marshaller		marshaller+RPC
simple types		passed			passed
compound types		passed			minor bugs found
buggy stream		passed			not run


Plan for the next week:
Fix bugs in RPC code for IDL-defined data types with arbitrary complexity.
Specification for resource manager and profile repository.
Finish specification for axis.queue protocol.

Help not needed

Other activities:
Finish reinstalling Linux on my workstation.
Lost 1 working day on medical care.
