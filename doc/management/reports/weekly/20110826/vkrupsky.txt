MP4 converter moved to Android side, so, created VideoView class that plays any MP4 file and standard HTTP server can be used for media streaming.
Problem with simple HTTP server found and fixed. Jetty server not needed.
HTTP server for devkit built (by Oksana). It works well for media streaming.
MPlayer built for devkit (by Oksana). It works well with HTTP server on Android.
